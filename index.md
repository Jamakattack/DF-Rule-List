:ballot_box_with_check: 2: Keep it friendly! Swearing is allowed, but do not go overboard with it. Excessive swearing is not allowed. (Ex. Saying fuck every sentence you make)

:ballot_box_with_check: 3: If you notice an admin/mod abusing his/her rights, please report it to an admin in a private message. Admins have Blue names and Moderators have a Orange one. Jmak is purple, cause I like Purple.

:ballot_box_with_check: 4: Post content in relevant channels, posts unrelated to their channel will be removed if found annoying/excessive.

:ballot_box_with_check: 5: Don’t spam! this goes for all channels! (This includes bot commands). (Ex. Spamming with ?info command from dyno or spamming tatsumaki commands,[playing slots or fishing is not spamming, nor is using the music bot])

:ballot_box_with_check: 6: Promotions are only allowed in #promotion. (Promote yourself or someone else!)

:ballot_box_with_check: 7: Do not ask for roles. If you do, it will just lower the chances of receiving one.

:ballot_box_with_check: 7: Do not spam mention ANYBODY. This includes Mentioning a mod/admin for nothing. Only ping mods and admins for important matters, not your silly games.  Though if there is actually an issues going on in a channel and a mod is not there Please @Mod so a mod to handle it.

:ballot_box_with_check: 8: NO LINKS IN GENERAL. General chat is for General topics.

:ballot_box_with_check: 9: No hate speech of any kind. Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive. Comments such as this will result in an immediate ban.

ALL OF THESE RULES GO APPLY IN TEXT CHANNELS AS WELL AS VOICE CHANNELS!!!



### For Our Mods

★ Do not base your judgement on opinion or your personal problem with the situation.

★ Delete the blocked words that were bypassed. You know what these words are.

★ Talk with your team about situations happening, if you are not sure on a kick/ban or even to delete a message. Ask another mod or Kira and Jmak will help. And please dont talk too much about Modchat with Non Mods. 

★ Delete mass spam - Our automod system will take care of most spam messages. Example being mass emoji spam, message spam, mass mentions and other spam. If the bot fails to do so, it's your job to get rid of spam.

★ Delete any weird looking links, you can send the links to Jmak if you are not sure.

★ Please read and update yourself in the mod chat often a lot of things can change in a day.

★ Please if you can show up as online when you are active (Kira needs sleep and has no idea when mods are even around)
